## How to use MediRepo

### Hospitals

See API documentation:

[![postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation%20in-postman-orange?logo=postman)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15643514/TzzBpFsL)

1. Use you API to create an account
2. Send new bulletins to our endpoint
3. Share the Patient Code and Attendance Code (this is the password) to the patient's family

Using the same patient Code and attendance Code, only the last medical report will be shared.

With Medirepo API you can send medical reports to the application easier, set up your main application to communicate with our REST API.

You can use the frontend application to create/edit bulletins manually.

### Patient's Family

ðŸŽƒ HacktoberFest is digitaloceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructureâ€”including some of digitaloceanâ€™s own productsâ€”relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often donâ€™t have the staff or budgets to do much more than keeping the project alive. ðŸŽƒ HacktoberFest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
