## Introduction

MediRepo is an Elixir/Phoenix API designed to facilitate communication between hospitals and patients' families by sharing Daily Medical Reports. In the midst of COVID-19 restrictions on hospital visits, this project aims to bridge the gap and provide essential medical information to concerned families.

## Front End

For the corresponding front-end (React) repository, visit:
[MediRepo Web Repository](https://github.com/AndrGab/medirepoWeb)

## Live Demo

Experience the live demo application by visiting:
[MediRepo Demo](https://medirepo.vercel.app/)

## How to Use MediRepo

### For Hospitals

#### API Documentation

Access our comprehensive API documentation on Postman:
[![Postman Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation%20in-postman-orange?logo=postman)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15643514/TzzBpFsL)

1. Create a hospital account using our API.
2. Utilize our endpoint to submit daily medical bulletins.
3. Share the Patient Code and Attendance Code (password) with the patient's family.

By using the same Patient Code and Attendance Code, only the latest medical report will be shared automatically. Integrate MediRepo API with your main application to streamline medical report submission, or use the web application for manual bulletin creation and editing.

### For Patients' Families

1. Access the user-friendly interface of [MediRepo Web](https://medirepo.vercel.app/) to view medical reports.

## Local Setup Guide

1. Fork the project and clone it to your local computer:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/medirepo.git
```

2. Install required libraries (refer to `.tool-versions` file for version specifications):

```bash
mix deps.get
```

3. Ensure that Postgres is running.

4. Set up the database:

```bash
mix ecto.setup
```

5. Use the `.env-sample` file to create your environment variables. Configure your SMTP server username and password. If you don't have an SMTP server, you can create one with any name. In the development environment, you can access sent emails using Bamboo viewer (localhost:4000/sent_emails).

6. Run the project:

```bash
iex -S mix phx.server
```

### What is Hacktoberfest?

ðŸŽƒ HacktoberFest is digitaloceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructureâ€”including some of digitaloceanâ€™s own productsâ€”relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often donâ€™t have the staff or budgets to do much more than keeping the project alive. ðŸŽƒ HacktoberFest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
